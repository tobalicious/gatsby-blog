# Exploring the Relationship between Workplace Freedom of Speech, Organizational Identification, and Employee Dissent

“... purpose... examine how subordinates perceptions of workplace freedom of speech related to their levels of organizational identification and their strategies for expressing dissent.” “Results indicated that organizational identification as well as expression of articulated dissent and latent dissent varied as a function of workplace freedom of speech”

Modern organizations experimenting with more democratic and participative forms of organizing espouse desires to solicit employee feedback and envoy emend. BUT, this democratization of organizational structure does not necessarily equate to more democratic discourse in organizations. (Barker 1993, 1994, Gorden, Holmberg and Hersey, 1994)

Research has broken dissent messaging down into two categories: “personal-advantage” (disagreeing when one’s hours or cut, extra duties are required, or they are otherwise personally affected), and “principled dissent messages” (disagreement with business practices or decisions).

Some studies found that managerial roles and argumentative ness predicted use of articulated dissent, and no management roles and verbal aggressiveness predicted latent dissent. Other studies also showed that higher-quality relationships with supervisors created more articulated dissent, and less latent dissent. Lower quality relationships, then, increased latent dissent. Employee satisfaction, employee commitment, and perception of personal influence were all positively related to articulated dissent and negatively related to latent dissent.

All this to say, dissent is a multi-factored problem, and employees choose their dissent strategies in light of their organization’s influences on those factors.

**Organizational Identification**

(Tompkins and Cheney, 1985) “the act of [organizational] identification leads the decision maker to select a particular alternative, to choose one course of action over another”. Identification reduces the range of decisions by confining the choices available to alternatives associated with one’s targets of identification. Layman’s terms: when you choose your identity, you’re confining yourself to options available to someone with that identity. You then become biased to their targets of identification. Across and organizational level or these individual, the organization becomes more concerned with enticing decision makers to choose alternatives that are consonant with organizational values and goals.

This organizational identification guides behavior by influencing which problems and alternatives appear most salient to organizational success. “A decision maker identifies with an organization when he or she desires to choose the alternative that best promotes the _perceived_ interests of the organization”

Research (Tompkins and Cheney 1985) show that highly identified employees reported using decision making premises that were aligned with organizational values, and low identifying employees used frameworks that did not resemble organizational values.

(Bullis and Bach, 1991) found that organizational identification is a function of the nature and type of communication that occurs within organizations.

### Workplace Freedom of Speech

(Gorden and Infante 1987) suggest that supervisors that affirm subordinates’ self-concepts result in higher productivity, satisfaction and organizational commitment. They believe this is a function of acts of free speech and argumentation.

“Did not feel the need to salute ideas” is a good quote for organizational affirming behaviors. This comes from a study of W. L. Gore and Associates in Pacanowsky 1998. Saluting ideas is how I feel about growth mindset philosophies.

If organizational identification is a function of communication, then it is a function of freedom of speech. It follows that organizations successfully build climates that generate freedom of speech, then voicing of opinions and dissent would become an organizational value and part of the organizational identification biases.

The hypothesis of this paper is that “Employees who perceive more workspace freedom of speech exists in their organizations will report higher levels of organizational identification than employees who perceive less workplace freedom of speech.”

Hypothesis two follows easily: “Employees who perceive more workplace freedom of speech exists in their organizations will report using more articulated dissent and less latent dissent than employees who perceive less workplace freedom or speech exists”

### Results and Discussions

Data showed strong support for both hypotheses: Organizational identification and choices about how they expressed dissent varied with their _perceptions_ of workplace freedom of speech.

There is also support in the data that democratic discourse and higher levels of freedom of speech is “as crucial or more crucial” than structures that are democratic. It is possible to achieve an “aura” of democracy without these structures in place.

Previous research suggests that perceptions of loyalty and similarity are key components of organization identification (Johnson, Johnson & Heimberg, 1999). The research here could imply a further relationship to freedom of speech.
